I'm a Brazilian, non-binary, curious person, trying to tackle new passions and learn every day. âœ¨

I have a bachelor in Lettres, and ended up falling in love with Linguistics halfway through my undergrad years. Linguistics is the reason I started believing that maybe I could love Humanities and STEM at the same time.

I am currently doing an undergraduate bachelor's degree in Computer Science because learning by myself was not working, for the many years since I started my journey to learn how to code.

My ultimate goal is to understand more about Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity.

My pronouns are they/them :wink:, but due to my native language's heavily gendered nature, I also go by she/her. ðŸ¤”

If you want to see how I'm doing on my coding journey, you can find me at:

**Codewars**: @luisalopes
**Codepen**: @luisalopes
**Exercism**: @luisalopes
**Kaggle**: @luisalopes

As soon as I have an exciting project, be sure it'll be shared here on my Github profile! See you soon. ðŸ‘‹
