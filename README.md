I'm a Brazilian, non-binary, smol and curious student.

Graduated in a Humanities major, I ended up falling in love with Linguistics halfway through my undergrad years. Now I seek to dive deeper into the subject by tapping into knowledge that previously intimidated me.

I'm still at the beginning of my learning journey, with only a mild understanding of HTML and CSS, but I hope that, with time, I'll reach my main goal of working with programming.

At the moment, I'm starting to dive into JavaScript.

Pronouns: they/them.
