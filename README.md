I'm a Brazilian, non-binary, curious person, trying to tackle new passions and learn everyday. âœ¨

Graduated in a Humanities major, I ended up falling in love with Linguistics halfway through my undergrad years. Now I seek to dive deeper into the subject by tapping into knowledge that previously intimidated me.

I'm still at the beginning of my learning journey, with only a mild understanding of HTML and CSS, but I hope that, with time, I'll reach my main goal of working with programming.

At the moment, I'm starting to dive into Python, but my ultimate goal is to understand about Artificial Intelligence and cybersecurity. :fire:

I'm picking up new interests along the way, like software and app development, and it might make my journey longer than I initially thought, but I see every new knowledge as a nice addition to my intellectual baggage. :sweat_smile:

My pronouns are they/them :wink:, but due to my native language's heavily gendered nature, I also go by she/her. ðŸ¤”

If you want to see how I'm doing on my coding journey, you can find me at:

Now I have a Figma prototype of what I want my portfolio website to look like (I mean, for now, since I still need to learn some stuff about UI Design...)! But alas, it's only in portuguese for now.

Here's the link: [Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/1XWYoMMiB8HxuvmKxKhIi1/Portf%C3%B3lio?node-id=5%3A0&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1)

As soon as I have an exciting project, be sure it'll be shared here on my Github profile! See you soon. ðŸ‘‹
